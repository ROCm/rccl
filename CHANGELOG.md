# Changelog for RCCL

Full documentation for RCCL is available at [https://rccl.readthedocs.io](https://rccl.readthedocs.io)

## Unreleased - RCCL 2.26.6 for ROCm 7.0.0

### Resolved issues

* Resolved an issue when using more than 64 channels when multiple collectives are used in the same `ncclGroup()` call.
* Fixed unit test failures in tests ending with `ManagedMem` and `ManagedMemGraph` suffixes.
* Suboptimal algorithmic switching point for AllReduce on MI300x.
* Fixed the known issue "When splitting a communicator using `ncclCommSplit` in some GPU configurations, MSCCL initialization can cause a segmentation fault." with a design change to use `comm` instead of `rank` for `mscclStatus`. The Global map for `comm` to `mscclStatus` is still not thread safe but should be explicitly handled by mutexes for read writes. This is tested for correctness, but there is a plan to use a thread-safe map data structure in upcoming changes.

### Added

* Added new GPU target `gfx950`.
* Added support for `unroll=1` in device-code generation to improve performance,
* Set a default of 112 channels for a single node with `8 * gfx950`,
* Enabled LL128 protocol on `gfx950`.
* Added MSCCL support for AllGather multinode gfx942/gfx950 (i.e., 16 and 32 GPUs). To enable, set the environment variable `RCCL_MSCCL_FORCE_ENABLE=1`. Max message size for MSCCL AllGather usage is `12292 * sizeof(datatype) * nGPUs`.
* Thread thresholds for LL/LL128 are selected in Tuning Models for the MI300X. This impacts the number of channels used for AG and RS. Channel tuning model is bypassed if `NCCL_THREAD_THRESHOLDS`, `NCCL_MIN_NCHANNELS', or 'NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS` are set.
* Multi-node tuning for AllGather, AllReduce, and ReduceScatter that leverages LL/LL64/LL128 protocol to use nontemporal vector load/store for tunable message size ranges.
* LL/LL128 usage ranges for AR, AG, and RS are part of the tuning models, which enable architecture-specific tuning in conjunction with the existing Rome Models scheme in RCCL.
* Two new APIs are exposed as part of an initiative to separate RCCL code. These APIs are `rcclGetAlgoInfo` and `rcclFuncMaxSendRecvCount`. However, user-level invocation requires that RCCL be built with `RCCL_EXPOSE_STATIC` enabled.
* Enabled double-buffering in `reduceCopyPacks` to trigger pipelining, especially to overlap bf16 arithmetic.
* Added `--force-reduce-pipeline` as an option that can be passed to the `install.sh` script. Passing this option will enable software-triggered pipelining `bfloat16` reductions (i.e. `all_reduce`, `reduce_scatter` and `reduce`).


### Changed

* Compatibility with NCCL 2.23.4
* Compatibility with NCCL 2.24.3
* Compatibility with NCCL 2.25.1
* Compatibility with NCCL 2.26.6

## RCCL 2.22.3 for ROCm 6.4.2

### Added

* Added support for the LL128 protocol on gfx942.

## RCCL 2.22.3 for ROCm 6.4.1

### Resolved issues

* Fixed the accuracy issue for MSCCLPP `allreduce7` kernel in graph mode.
* Fixed IntraNet performance.
* Fixed an issue where, in rare circumstances, the application could stop responding due to a proxy thread synchronization issue.

### Known issues

* When splitting a communicator using `ncclCommSplit` in some GPU configurations, MSCCL initialization can cause a segmentation fault.
  The recommended workaround is to disable MSCCL with `export RCCL_MSCCL_ENABLE=0`.
* Within the RCCL-UnitTests test suite, failures occur in tests ending with the `ManagedMem` and `ManagedMemGraph` suffixes. These failures only affect the test results and do not affect the RCCL component itself. This issue will be resolved in the next major release.

## RCCL 2.22.3 for ROCm 6.4.0

### Added

* `RCCL_SOCKET_REUSEADDR` and `RCCL_SOCKET_LINGER` environment parameters.
* Setting `NCCL_DEBUG=TRACE NCCL_DEBUG_SUBSYS=VERBS` will generate traces for fifo and data `ibv_post_sends`.
* Added `--log-trace` flag to enable traces through the install.sh script (e.g. `./install.sh --log-trace`).

### Changed

* Compatibility with NCCL 2.22.3
* Added support for the rail-optimized tree algorithm for the MI300 series. This feature requires the use of all eight GPUs within
  each node. It limits NIC traffic to use only GPUs of the same index across nodes and should not impact performance
  on non-rail-optimized network topologies. The original method of building trees can be enabled by setting the
  environment variable `RCCL_DISABLE_RAIL_TREES=1`.
* Additional debug information about how the trees are built can be logged to the GRAPH logging subsys by setting
  `RCCL_OUTPUT_TREES=1`.
* Added documentation about the NPS4 and CPX partition modes performance benefits on the MI300X.

### Optimizations
